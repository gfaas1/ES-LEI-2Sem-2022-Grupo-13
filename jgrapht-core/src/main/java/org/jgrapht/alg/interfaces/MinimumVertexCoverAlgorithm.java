/**
 * Computes a vertex cover in an undirected graph. A vertex cover of a graph is a set of vertices such that each edge of
 * the graph is incident to at least one vertex in the set. A minimum vertex cover is a vertex cover having the smallest
 * possible number of vertices for a given graph. The size of a minimum vertex cover of a graph G is known as the vertex
 * cover number. A vertex cover of minimum weight is a vertex cover where the sum of weights assigned to the individual
 * vertices in the cover has been minimized. The minimum vertex cover problem is a special case of the minimum weighted
 * vertex cover problem where all vertices have equal weight.
