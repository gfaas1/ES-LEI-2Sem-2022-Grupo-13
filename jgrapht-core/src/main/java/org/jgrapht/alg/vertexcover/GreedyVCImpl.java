/**
 * Greedy algorithm to find a vertex cover for a graph. A vertex cover is a set of
 * vertices that touches all the edges in the graph. The graph's vertex set is a
 * trivial cover. However, a <i>minimal</i> vertex set (or at least an
 * approximation for it) is usually desired. Finding a true minimal vertex cover
 * is an NP-Complete problem. For more on the vertex cover problem, see <a
 * href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/VertexCover.html">
 * http://mathworld.wolfram.com/VertexCover.html</a>
 *
 * Note: this class supports pseudo-graphs
 * Runtime: O(|E|*log|V|)
 * This class produces often, but not always, better solutions than the 2-approximation algorithms. Nevertheless, there are instances
 * where the solution is significantly worse. In those cases, consider using {@link ClarksonTwoApproxVCImpl}.
