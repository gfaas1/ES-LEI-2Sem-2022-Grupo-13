## Introduction ##

JGraphT is a free Java class library that provides mathematical graph-theory objects and algorithms. It runs on Java 2 Platform (requires JDK 1.6 or later).

JGraphT is licensed under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL). A copy of the [license](license-LGPL.txt) is included in the download.

Please note that JGraphT is distributed WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

## Getting Started ##

The package `org.jgrapht.demo` includes small demo applications to help you get started. If you spawn your own demo app and think others can use it, please send it to us and we will add it to that package.

## Upgrading Versions ##

To help upgrading, JGraphT maintains a one-version-backwards compatibility. While this compatibility is not a hard promise, it is generally respected. (This policy was not followed for the jump from `0.6.0` to `0.7.0` due to the pervasive changes required for generics.) You can upgrade via:

- **The safe way** : compile your app with the JGraphT version that immediately follows your existing version and follow the deprecation notes, if they exist, and modify your application accordingly. Then move to the next version, and on, until you're current.
- **The fast way** : go to the latest JGraphT right away - if it works, you're done.
  
Reading the [change history](HISTORY.md) is always recommended.

## Documentation ##

A local copy of the Javadoc HTML files is included in this distribution. The latest version of these files is also available [on-line](http://www.jgrapht.org/javadoc).

## Dependencies ##
